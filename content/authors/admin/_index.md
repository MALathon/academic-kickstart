Mark holds a PhD in biomedical engineering from the University of Rochester focused on understanding useful properties of nanomaterials and how best to leverage them to interact with and understand biological systems. He continued his education with a postdoctoral fellowship at Stanford, working on developing novel point-of-care diagnostics. Mark's work led him to his current position as data scientist and medical scientific affairs manager at Abbott, where he works full-time on researching and developing novel hematology products. 

He is currently focusing on developing his teaching and mentorship talents, designing courses focused on his experience with diagnostics, biomedical optics, and computer algorithms for biology. 

Mark has one child (and another on the way!), with a beautiful wife and two claw-y cats. In his downtime he likes to play video games (especially roguelikes!), and would like to one day develop his own masterpiece roguelike.
